# FenceGateCounter
Lets assume a scenario: there are sheep that a shepherd needs to fence at the end of a long day. 

With the help of two ultrasonic sensors connected to Arduino Board, we can detect the number of sheep that pass through the gate into the fenced area.
The first sensor with tg1 and ech1 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects movement into the gate. The second sensor with tg2 and ech2 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects out of the gate.
